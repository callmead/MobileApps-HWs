Install Android Studio on your laptop (or desktop) computer and test
your installation by creating your first Android "Hello World" app
that requires no coding. Android Studio is available from
http://developer.android.com/studio/ and the current version is 3.1.3.

Read Chapter 1 of the textbook (or Chapter 1 of [GG17]) for installing
Android Studio and creating your first, "Hello World" app. Use the
following configuration for your app.

  Application name: Hello World
  Company domain: cs4330.cs.utep.edu

Answer the following questions. If your answer is "No", describe
briefly the issues or difficulties that you encountered along with
your plan for addressing them.

1. Have you read Chapter 1 of the textbook? Yes / No

2. Were you able to install and configure Android Studio? Yes / No
   
3. Were you able to create your Hello World app? Yes / No

   a. By targetting API 16 (Android 4.1 Jelly Bean), your app will
      run on approximaely ____% of devices (as of July ___, 2018).

4. Were you able to run the app on an emulator (AVD)? Yes / No

5. Were you able to run the app on an Android device? Yes / No
   
   Refer to an online document entitled "Run apps on a hardware device"
   (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device/) or read
   pages 108-110 of [Chapter 3, GG17] to set up an Android device like
   a smartphone for app development.
   
   On most Android devices (since Android 4.0), the developer
   mode/settings ("Developer options) is disabled/hidden by default,
   and you need to tap some secret keys to reveal it. On my Samsung
   Galaxy 7, for example, I have to tap "Settings > Device > Software
   info > Build number" 7 times to bring up the Developer
   Settings. Refer to your device's manual.
   
6. Any lessons you learned or advice to others?

7. Change your app's "Hello world!" message to "Hello <your-name>!"
   and include a screen of the app in your submission.

   Edit app/res/layout/activity_main.xml (or content_main.xml)
   to change the android:text property of the TexView.
